Today I spent some time to explore VIM editor plugins.

Post 8.x VIM release, there are two ways one can install plugins in VIM.

1. Directly copying the plugin packages to ~/.vim/pack/plugin-name/start path
2. using plugin managers. Most notable one being vim-plugin.

I have been using this editor for around 5 years and I didn't realise that I 
was missing on such good features provided by some plugins.

Explored following plugins today:

* NERDTree    - gives the tree view of PWD within in terminal
* vim-airline - helps to get a bar with good details of file name, encoding, 
                type of file,  etc
* fzf/fzf.vim - This is fuzzy finder. There is a whole lot to learn about this.

I will continue exploring these further this week. Will write about each of
these under Editors section in root folder.

1. Spent good time mentoring intern. Was able to verify half the path in cycle.
2. Tried exploring dpdk further to verify behaviour with checksum. Found that
   there is an option to offload checksum creation and verification to hardware
   by setting some flags in `rxmode.hw_ip_checksum` in `rte_eth_conf` structure.
   These flags are not present in latest dpdk.
4. Did some tests to verify whether checksum offload works in rx path. 
   Still WIP. 
3. Total time in meetings : 3 hours
